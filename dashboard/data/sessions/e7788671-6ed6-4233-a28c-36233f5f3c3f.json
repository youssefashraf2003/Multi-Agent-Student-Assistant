The title \"Attention\" and the detailed explanation of the attention mechanism suggest that attention is a crucial component of the model. The paper \"Attention is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. (2017) is likely being referenced, which introduced the Transformer model and highlighted the importance of attention in neural networks."
