According to Wikipedia, LLMs are capable of generating, summarizing, translating, and reasoning over text, and they can be fine-tuned for specific tasks. They consist of billions to trillions of parameters and operate as general-purpose sequence models. LLMs have evolved from earlier statistical and recurrent neural network approaches to language modeling, with the transformer architecture enabling efficient parallelization, longer context handling, and scalable training on large data volumes. This has led to the development of models like GPT and BERT, which have demonstrated emergent capabilities such as conversational agents, code generation, knowledge retrieval, and automated reasoning.
