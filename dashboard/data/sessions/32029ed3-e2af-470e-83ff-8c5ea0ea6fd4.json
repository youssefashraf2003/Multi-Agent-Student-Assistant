            "content": "A transformer can refer to two different concepts. In electrical engineering, a transformer is a passive component that transfers electrical energy from one circuit to another through electromagnetic induction, allowing for the change of AC voltage levels and providing galvanic isolation between circuits. This concept has been essential for the transmission, distribution, and utilization of alternating current electric power since its invention in 1885.\n\nIn deep learning, the transformer is a neural network architecture introduced in 2017, which relies on the multi-head attention mechanism to process sequential data, such as text. This architecture has revolutionized the field of natural language processing and has been widely adopted for training large language models, computer vision, and other applications. The transformer architecture has the advantage of requiring less training time than earlier recurrent neural architectures and has led to the development of pre-trained systems like generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and BERT.\n\nThe information about transformers in electrical engineering was found on the Wikipedia page \"Transformer\", while the information about transformers in deep learning was found on the Wikipedia page \"Transformer (deep learning)\".",
