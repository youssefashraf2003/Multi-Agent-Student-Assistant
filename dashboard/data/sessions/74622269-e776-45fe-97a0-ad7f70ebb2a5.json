In the context of entertainment, Transformers is a Japanese-American media franchise produced by Hasbro and Takara Tomy, which encompasses toys, animation, comic books, video games, and films, and follows the story of heroic Autobots and villainous Decepticons, two alien robot factions at war that can transform into other forms (information from Wikipedia). \n\nIn the context of artificial intelligence and machine learning, a transformer is a deep learning architecture introduced in the 2017 paper \"Attention Is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. (information from Search). This architecture is designed to process sequential data, such as text, and is widely used in natural language processing tasks. It has become a foundational component of modern artificial intelligence and is used in a variety of applications, including large language models (information from Search and Arxiv). \n\nIn summary, the meaning of \"transformers\" depends on the context in which it is used, referring either to a media franchise or a deep learning architecture in artificial intelligence.",
